You can monitor your organization's licenses and subscriptions through the digital wallet *Overview* tab. It highlights the current capacity of each of your data services licenses and subscriptions as well as directs you to take action on issues you may have, such as expiring licenses.

Monitoring the health of your license and subscription status ensures that you can manage costs and maintain service as subscriptions reach expiration dates. You can use the *Overview* page to get high-level view into the consumed capacity of each of your licenses and subscriptions. You can also see distribution view of how many licenses and subscriptions of each type that your organization has.

To view information about specific data services (including Cloud Volumes ONTAP), you drill-down into respective data services to view details on what subscriptions and licenses are associated with each.
