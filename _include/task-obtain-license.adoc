After you purchase a license, you can activate the license in BlueXP either by entering the serial number and NSS account, or by uploading the NetApp license file (NLF). You should obtain a NetApp license file to upload if BlueXP does not have internet access.

If you’re running BlueXP in an on-premises site that doesn’t have internet access (private mode),
, you’ll need to obtain the license file from an internet-connected system. Activating the license using the serial number and NetApp Support Site account
is not available for private mode installations.

The steps below show how to get the NetApp license file from the NetApp support site.

.Steps

. Find your BlueXP account ID:

.. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.
.. On the Organization page, look for your account ID and copy it. 
+
If there is no account ID listed and you just have an organization ID, then you'll need to copy the first eight characters of the organization ID and append it to _account-_
+
For example, let's say this is your organization ID:
+
ea10e1c6-80cc-4219-8e99-3c3e6b161ba5
+
Your account ID would be as follows: 
+
account-ea10e1c6

. Sign in to the https://mysupport.netapp.com[NetApp Support Site^] and select *Systems > Software Licenses*.

. Enter the serial number for your license.
