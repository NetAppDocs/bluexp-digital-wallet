You should obtain a NetApp license file to upload if BlueXP does not have internet access (private mode installations).

After you purchase a license from your NetApp sales representative, NetApp sends you an email with the serial number and additional licensing details. In the case where you do not see your licenses automatically, you'll need that serial number to obtain the respective license file.


.Steps

. Find your BlueXP account ID:

.. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.
.. On the Organization page, look for your account ID and copy it. 
+
If there is no account ID listed and you just have an organization ID, then you'll need to copy the first eight characters of the organization ID and append it to _account-_
+
For example, let's say this is your organization ID:
+
ea10e1c6-80cc-4219-8e99-3c3e6b161ba5
+
Your account ID would be as follows: 
+
account-ea10e1c6

. Sign in to the https://mysupport.netapp.com[NetApp Support Site^] and select *Systems > Software Licenses*.

. Enter the serial number for your license.
