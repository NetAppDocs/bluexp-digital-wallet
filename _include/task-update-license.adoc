If your licensed term is nearing the expiration date, or if your licensed capacity is reaching the limit, you'll be notified in the BlueXP digital wallet. You can update your license before it expires so that there is no interruption in your ability to use a BlueXP data service or Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

##TIP: Consider also subscribing to the marketplace offering. Your license is always charged first, but you'll be charged at the hourly rate if you exceed your licensed capacity or if the license's term expires.##

If you purchased additional capacity from NetApp or extended the term of your license, BlueXP automatically updates the license in the digital wallet. 

However, if you deployed BlueXP in a location that doesn't have internet access, then you'll need to manually update the license file (or _files_ if you have a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair) in BlueXP.

After you pay for the license and it is registered with the NetApp Support Site, BlueXP automatically updates the license in the BlueXP digital wallet and the Data service licenses page will reflect the change in 5 to 10 minutes.

. If BlueXP can't automatically update the license (for example, when using BlueXP in private mode), then you'll need to obtain a NetApp license file from support and manually upload the license file. <<obtain-license,Learn how to obtain a license file.>>
