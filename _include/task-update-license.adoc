If your licensed term is nearing the expiration date, or if your licensed capacity is reaching the limit, you'll be notified in the BlueXP digital wallet. You can update your license before it expires so that there is no interruption in your ability to use the BlueXP data service or Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

TIP: Consider also subscribing to the marketplace offering. Your license is always charged first, but you'll be charged at the hourly rate if you exceed your licensed capacity or if the license's term expires.

If you purchased additional capacity from NetApp or extended the term of your license, BlueXP automatically updates the license in the digital wallet. There's nothing that you need to do.

However, if you deployed BlueXP in a location that doesn't have internet access, then you'll need to manually update the license file (or _files_ if you have an HA pair) in BlueXP.


NOTE: For more information on how to obtain a license file, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-manage-node-licenses.html#obtain-a-system-license-file[Obtain a system license file^].
