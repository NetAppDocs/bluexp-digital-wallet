In order to add a license to BlueXP, you can either provide BlueXP the serial number of the license or upload the license file(s). 

Both licenses and subscriptions automatically display in digital wallet when the BlueXP account used to subscribe is also an NetApp Support Site account. If you used a BlueXP account that is not associated with your NSS account, you'll need to manually add a license.
