When you subscribe to BlueXP from a cloud provider's marketplace, you're redirected to the BlueXP website where you need to save your subscription and configure it with specific cloud credentials (connector credentials). After you've subscribed, each subscription is available to manage from the BlueXP digital wallet.

== View your subscriptions

The BlueXP digital wallet provides details about each PAYGO subscription and annual contract associated with your BlueXP organization or account, and with Astra Control (Astra Control uses BlueXP's charging service).

For Google Cloud, you can also identify marketplace subscriptions that are associated with a private offer, which enables you to verify that you've successfully accepted the offer.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. Select *Marketplace Subscriptions*.
+
You'll only see the subscriptions that are associated with the organization that you are that you're currently viewing. 
*Draft questions* 
****
We use the word "account" throughout these topics and I think it is too vague. Are we talking about your user account, or a connector cloud account (credential)?
Should we say organization or subscriptions associated with the organization or project you have permission to view? When we say "account" here are we referring to the Connector?
****
. As you view the information about your subscriptions, you can interact with the details in the table as follows:
+
* Use Advanced Search and Filtering to determine which subscriptions are shown in the table. You can search by a a specific name of a subscription and filter by a variety of subscription parameters such as type and configuration.
+
* Expand a row to view more details.

* Select image:icon-column-selector.png[the plus icon at the end of the table header] to choose which columns appear in the table. 
+
Note that the Term and Auto Renew columns don't appear by default. The Auto Renew column displays renewal information for Azure contracts only.

+
Note the following about what you see in the table:

Start date::
The start date is when you successfully associated the subscription with your account and charging started.

N/A::
If you see N/A in the table, the information isn't available from the cloud provider's API at this time.

Term::
If your Google Cloud subscription is associated with a private offer and that private offer was modified after it was created and accepted, then the term shows N/A. In this scenario, the API response that we receive from the Google Cloud Marketplace doesn't include term-related information.

Contracts::
* If you expand the details for a contract, the BlueXP digital wallet shows what's available for your current plan: the contract options and units (capacity or number of nodes).
* The BlueXP digital wallet identifies the end date and whether the contract will renew soon, end soon, or whether it has already ended.
* If you have an AWS contract and you changed any of the contract's options after the start date, be sure to validate your contract options from the AWS Marketplace.
* If you have a Google Cloud private offer, contract options aren't available.

== Rename a subscription

You can rename your subscriptions to better identify how they are used in your organization.

For example, if you have two BlueXP organizations and each is billed through separate subscriptions. You might disassociate a subscription from one of the organizations so the users in that organization don't accidentally choose the wrong subscription when creating a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.

BlueXP supports Identity and Access Management (IAM) standard mode which uses organizations to manage users and resources. If you're using BlueXP in restricted mode or private mode, then you use a BlueXP _account_ to manage users and resources.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. Select *Marketplace Subscriptions*.

. Select the action menu in the row that corresponds to the subscription that you want to manage and choose Rename.

== Configure a subscription with a provider credential

Subscriptions are typically configured with a provider credential that you created when you subscribed. In some cases, you may need to reconfigure a subscription to use a different credential if you want to change the way it is charged. You can also do this from the Credentials page. 
In order to configure a subscription to a particular credential, you must select the connector that is associated with that credential. 
*Draft questions* 
****
Do we restrict access to credentials?  Should we just use the term "Organization credential" in the UI here to match how we are using it on the Credentials page?

We should probably add these instructions here:
Find your BlueXP account ID:

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console. > Identity & Access Management.

. On the Organization credentials tab, look for your account ID and copy it. 
 The account ID is named differently depending on the hyperscaler where you subscribed to BlueXP (or created your connector).


== Associate a subscription with a BlueXP organization

You can associate a subscription with one or more of your BlueXP organizations. This ensures that the members of that organization can use that subscription for charging. You must be an organization admin in order to associate a subscription.

For example, if you have two BlueXP organizations and each is billed through separate subscriptions. You might disassociate a subscription from one of the organizations so the users in that organization don't accidentally choose the wrong subscription when creating a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.
BlueXP supports Identity and Access Management (IAM) standard mode which uses organizations to manage users and resources. If you're using BlueXP in restricted mode or private mode, then you use a BlueXP _account_ to manage users and resources.
*Draft questions* 
****
What happens when you have more than one organization? Is this step mandatory? Will the subscription be auto-assigned if you have one organization? Is there a default org that will be used?  Also this term is used on the Credentials page. We should change the credentials term to be Configure to match what it actually does and to align with how we are using Configure in the digital wallet.
