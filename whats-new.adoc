=== Deployment modes

BlueXP _deployment modes_ enable you to use BlueXP in a way that meets your business and security requirements. You can choose from three modes:

* Standard mode
* Restricted mode
* Private mode

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/concept-modes.html[Learn more about these deployment modes].

NOTE: The introduction of restricted mode replaces the option to enable or disable the SaaS platform. You can enable restricted mode at the time of account creation. It can't be enabled or disabled later.
