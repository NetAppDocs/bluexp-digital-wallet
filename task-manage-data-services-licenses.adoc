The BlueXP digital wallet enables you to manage licenses that you purchased directly from NetApp (BYOL) for use with BlueXP data services as well as Cloud Volumes for ONTAP. You can view used license capacity, how much free capacity you have left, and you'll see notifications if you reached the capacity limit or the expiration date.

The instructions on this page provide information that applies to each service, including Cloud Volumes for ONTAP. For more specific information about the licensing for these services, refer to the following pages:

TIP: The BlueXP digital wallet also enables you to manage licenses for BlueXP classification. However, BlueXP classification is now available as a core capability within BlueXP at no additional charge. A license or subscription is no longer required. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-classification/concept-cloud-compliance.html[Learn more about BlueXP classification^]
