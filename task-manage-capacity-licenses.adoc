Manage your capacity-based licenses for BlueXP Cloud Volumes ONTAP from digital wallet to ensure that your NetApp account has enough capacity for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

The _BlueXP digital wallet_ enables you to manage your licenses for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses, as well as run usage reports. Cloud Volumes for ONTAP uses a capacity-based model where _Capacity-based licenses_ enable you to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP per TiB of capacity.

NOTE: While the actual usage and metering for the products and services managed in BlueXP are always calculated in GiB and TiB, the terms GB/GiB and TB/TiB are used interchangeably. This is reflected in the Cloud Marketplace listings, price quotes, listing descriptions, and other supporting documentation.

== How licenses are added to the BlueXP digital wallet

After you purchase a license from your NetApp sales representative, NetApp sends you an email with the serial number and additional licensing details.

In the meantime, BlueXP automatically queries NetApp's licensing service to obtain details about the licenses associated with your NetApp Support Site account. If there are no errors, BlueXP automatically adds the licenses to the digital wallet.

If BlueXP can't add the license, you'll need to manually add it to the digital wallet yourself. For example, if your Connector (enables BlueXP to communicate with NetApp) is installed in a location that doesn't have internet access, you'll need to add the licenses yourself.

== Obtain a license file

In some cases, you may not see your licenses automatically display in digital wallet after your purchase. This happens either when BlueXP is not connected to the internet or when your BlueXP account is not associated with your NetApp Support Site (NSS) account.


After you purchase a license, you can add the license in BlueXP either by entering the serial number and the associated NSS account, or by uploading the NetApp license file (NLF). You should obtain a NetApp license file to upload if BlueXP does not have internet access (private mode installations).

NOTE: If you want to enter the serial number, you first need to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-nss-accounts.html[add your NetApp Support Site account to BlueXP^]. This is the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.

The steps below show how to get the NetApp license file from the NetApp support site.

.Steps

. Find your BlueXP account ID:

.. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select image:icon-settings-option.png[The settings icon which displays in the top right of the BlueXP web console.] > *Identity & Access Management*.
.. On the Organization page, look for your account ID and copy it. 
+
If there is no account ID listed and you just have an organization ID, then you'll need to copy the first eight characters of the organization ID and append it to _account-_
+
For example, let's say this is your organization ID:
+
ea10e1c6-80cc-4219-8e99-3c3e6b161ba5
+
Your account ID would be as follows: 
+
account-ea10e1c6

. Sign in to the https://mysupport.netapp.com[NetApp Support Site^] and select *Systems > Software Licenses*.

. Enter the serial number for your license.
+

. In the *License Key* column, select *Get NetApp License File*.

. Enter your BlueXP account ID (this is called a Tenant ID on the support site) and select *Submit* to download the license file.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_backup_license_step2.gif[A screenshot that shows the get license dialog box where you enter your tenant ID and then select Submit to download the license file.]

== Add purchased licenses to your account

If you don't see your purchased licenses in the BlueXP digital wallet, you'll need to add the license file (or _files_ if you have an HA pair) to BlueXP so that the capacity is available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

In order to add a license to BlueXP, you can either provide BlueXP with the serial number of the license or upload the license file(s). 

NOTE: If you want to enter the serial number, you first need to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-nss-accounts.html[add your NetApp Support Site account to BlueXP^]. This is the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet* and then select the *Data service licenses* tab.

. Select *Add license*.

. In the _Add license_ dialog, enter the license information and select *Add license*:
+
* If you have the serial number and know your NSS account, select the *Enter serial number* option and enter that information.
+
If you entered a serial number, you also need to select the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.
+
If your NetApp Support Site account isn't available from the drop-down list, https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-nss-accounts.html[add the NSS account to BlueXP^]

* If you have the license file (required when using BlueXP in private mode), select the *Upload license file* option and follow the prompts to attach the file. <<obtain-license,Learn how to obtain a license file.>>

include::_include/task-update-license.adoc[]

== Remove a capacity-based license

If a capacity-based license is expired and is no longer in use, then you can remove it.

To learn about what happens to your Cloud Volumes ONTAP data on expiration or removal of your license, refer to https://kb.netapp.com/Cloud/Cloud_Volumes_ONTAP/FAQs_on_Cloud_Volumes_ONTAP_license_expiry[this knowledge base (KB) article^].

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. On the _Data service licenses_ tab, select image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the  serial number you are updating, and select *Remove License*.

. Select *Remove* to confirm.

== View the consumed capacity in your account

The BlueXP digital wallet shows you the total consumed capacity in your account and the consumed capacity by licensing package. This can help you understand how you're being charged and whether you need to purchase additional capacity.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. On the *Overview* tab, the Cloud Volumes ONTAP tile displays the current capacity used for your account. 
+
image:screenshot_cvo_overview_digital_wallet.png[a screenshot displaying the capacity summary for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses and subscriptions.]
+
* _Data service license_ is the total provisioned capacity of all Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in your NetApp account. The charging is based on each volume's provisioned size, regardless of local, used, stored, or effective space within the volume.
+
* _Annual contract_ is the total licensed capacity (bring your own license (BYOL) or Marketplace Contract) that you purchased from NetApp.
+
* _PAYGO_ is the total provisioned capacity using cloud marketplace subscriptions. Charging via PAYGO is used only if the consumed capacity is higher than the licensed capacity or if there is no BYOL license available in the BlueXP digital wallet.
+

. Select *View* to see the consumed capacity for each of your licensing packages.
+
. Select the *Licenses* tab to see details for each package license that you have purchased.
+
To better understand the capacities that display for the Essentials package, you should be familiar with how charging works. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-licensing.html#notes-about-charging[Learn about charging for the Essentials package].
+
. Select the *Subscriptions* tab to see the consumed capacity by license consumption model. This tab includes both PAYGO and annual contract licenses. 
+ 
You'll only see the subscriptions that are associated with the organization that you are that you're currently viewing. 
+
. As you view the information about your subscriptions, you can interact with the details in the table as follows:
+
* Expand a row to view more details.
+
image:screenshot-subscriptions-expand.png[A screenshot of the Subscriptions tab in the digital wallet where you can select the arrow at the end of a row to expand it.]

* Select image:icon-column-selector.png[the plus icon at the end of the table header] to choose which columns appear in the table. 
Note that the Term and Auto Renew columns don't appear by default. The Auto Renew column displays renewal information for Azure contracts only.

=== Download usage reports

You can download four usage reports from the BlueXP digital wallet. These usage reports provide capacity details of your subscriptions and tell you how you're being charged for the resources in your Cloud Volumes ONTAP subscriptions. The downloadable reports capture data at a point in time and can be easily shared with others.
