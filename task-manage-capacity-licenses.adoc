The _BlueXP digital wallet_ enables you to manage your licenses for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses, as well as run usage reports. Cloud Volumes for ONTAP uses a capacity-based model where _Capacity-based licenses_ enable you to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP per TiB of capacity.

NOTE: While the actual usage and metering for the products and services managed in BlueXP are always calculated in GiB and TiB, the terms GB/GiB and TB/TiB are used interchangeably. This is reflected in the Cloud Marketplace listings, price quotes, listing descriptions, and in other supporting documentation

== How licenses are added to the BlueXP digital wallet

After you purchase a license from your NetApp sales representative, NetApp sends you an email with the serial number and additional licensing details.

In the meantime, BlueXP automatically queries NetApp's licensing service to obtain details about the licenses associated with your NetApp Support Site account. If there are no errors, BlueXP automatically adds the licenses to the digital wallet.

If BlueXP can't add the license, you'll need to manually add it to the digital wallet yourself. For example, if your Connector (used to help BlueXP communicate with NetApp) is installed in a location that doesn't have internet access, you'll need to add the licenses yourself.

== View the consumed capacity in your account

The BlueXP digital wallet shows you the total consumed capacity in your account and the consumed capacity by licensing package. This can help you understand how you're being charged and whether you need to purchase additional capacity.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. On the *Overview* tab, the Cloud Volumes ONTAP tile displays the current capacity used for your account. 
+
image:screenshot_cvo_overview_digital_wallet.png[a screenshot displaying the capacity summary for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses and subscriptions.]
+
* _Data services_ is the total provisioned capacity of all Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in your NetApp account. The charging is based on each volume's provisioned size, regardless of local, used, stored, or effective space within the volume.
+
* _Annual contract_ is the total licensed capacity (bring your own license (BYOL) or Marketplace Contract) that you purchased from NetApp.
+
* _PAYGO_ is the total provisioned capacity using cloud marketplace subscriptions. Charging via PAYGO is used only if the consumed capacity is higher than the licensed capacity or if there is no BYOL license available in the BlueXP digital wallet.
+

. Select *View* to see the consumed capacity for each of your licensing packages.
+
. Select the *Licenses* tab shows you each package license that you have purchased.
+
To better understand the capacities that display for the Essentials package, you should be familiar with how charging works. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-licensing.html#notes-about-charging[Learn about charging for the Essentials package].
+
. Select the *Subscriptions* tab to see the consumed capacity by license consumption model and includes both PAYGO and annual contract licenses. 
You'll only see the subscriptions that are associated with the organization that you are that you're currently viewing. 

. As you view the information about your subscriptions, you can interact with the details in the table as follows:
+
* Expand a row to view more details.

* Select image:icon-column-selector.png[the plus icon at the end of the table header] to choose which columns appear in the table. 
Note that the Term and Auto Renew columns don't appear by default. The Auto Renew column displays renewal information for Azure contracts only.

=== Download usage reports

You can download four usage reports from the BlueXP digital wallet. These usage reports provide capacity details of your subscriptions and tell you how you're being charged for the resources in your Cloud Volumes ONTAP subscriptions. The downloadable reports capture data at a point in time and can be easily shared with others.

== Add purchased licenses to your account

If you don't see your purchased licenses in the BlueXP digital wallet, you'll need to add the license file (or _files_ if you have an HA pair) to BlueXP so that the capacity is available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Update a capacity-based license

include::_include/task-update-license.adoc[]


== Change charging methods

Capacity-based licensing is available in the form of a _package_. When you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, you can choose from several licensing packages based on your business needs. If your needs change after you create the working environment, you can change the package at any time. For example, you might change from the Essentials package to the Professional package.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-licensing.html[Learn more about capacity-based licensing packages^].

* Changing the charging method doesn't affect whether you're charged through a license purchased from NetApp (BYOL) or from your cloud provider's marketplace pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription. 
+
BlueXP always attempts to charge against a license first. If a license isn't available, it charges against a marketplace subscription. No "conversion" is required for BYOL to marketplace subscription or vice versa.

* If you have a private offer or contract from your cloud provider's marketplace, changing to a charging method that's not included in your contract will result in charging against BYOL (if you purchased a license from NetApp) or PAYGO.
<TONIA: these steps need to changed. Is this done through updating a license? If it still happens, which tab does it happen on?>

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. On the *Overview* tab, select *View* from the Cloud Volumes ONTAP tile.
+
image:screenshot-digital-wallet-charging-method-button.png[A screenshot of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP page in the BlueXP digital wallet where the Change Charging Method button is just above the table.]

. Select a working environment, choose the new charging method, and then confirm your understanding that changing the package type will affect service charges.
+
image:screenshot-digital-wallet-charging-method.png[A screenshot of the Change Charging Method dialog box where you choose a new charging method for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.]

. Select *Change Charging Method*.

.Result

BlueXP changes the charging method for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

You might also notice that the BlueXP digital wallet refreshes the consumed capacity for each package type to account for the change that you just made.

== Remove a capacity-based license
