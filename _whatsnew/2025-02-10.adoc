=== Configuring subscriptions to credentials
The BlueXP digital wallet now allows you to configure your subscriptions to provider credentials. Typically you do this when you first subscribe to a Marketplace subscription or annual contract. Previously changing the subscription's credentials could only be done on the Credentials page. 

=== Associating subscriptions with organizations
You can now update the organization to which a subscription is associated directly through the digital wallet.

=== Home page changes
The digital wallet homepage now provides a graphical view of all of your licenses and subscriptions, with the ability to drill-down into specific categories.

=== Managing Cloud Volume ONTAP licenses
You now manage Cloud Volume ONTAP licenses through the home page or the *Data service licenses tab*.
