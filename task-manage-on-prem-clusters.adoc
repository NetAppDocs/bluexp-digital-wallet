The BlueXP digital wallet enables you to view contract details for each of your on-prem ONTAP clusters. If you haven't discovered a cluster in BlueXP yet, you can also discover them from the digital wallet.

.Before you begin

The BlueXP digital wallet displays details about the on-premises ONTAP clusters that you discovered as a working environment or that are associated with a NetApp Support Site account that you added to BlueXP.

== View cluster information and contract details

View the status of the hardware and software contracts for your on-premises ONTAP clusters so that you can renew them before they expire. 

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. Select *On-Premises ONTAP*.
+
The Software Contract and Hardware Contract expiration dates appear on the line for each cluster.
+
If you are prompted to enter your NetApp Support Site (NSS) account credentials first, select *Add NSS Account*. After you add the account, the clusters associated with that NSS account appear.

. If the contract is close to the expiration date, or has expired, you can click the chat icon in the lower-right of the BlueXP console to request an extension to the contract.

. To view more details, click image:button_down_caret.png[A down-caret icon] to expand the cluster information.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. Select *On-Premises ONTAP*.

+
If you are prompted to enter your NetApp Support Site (NSS) account credentials first, select *Add NSS Account*. After you add the account, the clusters associated with that NSS account appear.

. Click *Discover* for the cluster that you want to manage through BlueXP.

. On the _Discover ONTAP Cluster_ page, enter the password for the admin user account and click *Discover*.

The status for the cluster turns to *Discovered* in the _On-Premises ONTAP_ page.

.Result

BlueXP discovers the cluster and adds it as a working environment in the Canvas. The working environment name is the name of the cluster.

You can enable services for this cluster in the right panel to replicate data to and from the cluster, set up data tiering to the cloud, back up volumes to the cloud, or run compliance scans on the volumes. You can also create new volumes or launch System Manager to perform advanced tasks.
