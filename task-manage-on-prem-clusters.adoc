The BlueXP digital wallet enables you to view contract details for each of your on-prem ONTAP clusters. If you haven't discovered a cluster in BlueXP yet, you can also discover them from the digital wallet.

.Before you begin

The BlueXP digital wallet displays details about the on-premises ONTAP clusters that you discovered as a working environment or that are associated with a NetApp Support Site account that you added to BlueXP.

== View cluster information and contract details

View the status of the hardware and software contracts for your on-premises ONTAP clusters so that you can renew them before they expire. 

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. Select *On-Premises ONTAP*.
+
The Software Contract and Hardware Contract expiration dates appear on the line for each cluster.
+
If you are prompted to enter your NetApp Support Site (NSS) account credentials first, select *Add NSS Account*. After you add the account, the clusters associated with that NSS account appear.

. If the contract is close to the expiration date, or has expired, you can select the chat icon in the lower-right of the BlueXP console to request an extension to the contract.

. To view more details, select image:button_down_caret.png[A down-caret icon] to expand the cluster information.

== Discover clusters

If you haven't discovered an on-premises ONTAP cluster as a working environment, you can do that from the BlueXP digital wallet. Once discovered, a cluster is available as a working environment in BlueXP so that you can manage it.

.Before you begin

You should understand your discovery and management options (discovery using a Connector or direct discovery without a Connector) as well as discovery requirements.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[Learn about discovery options and requirements^].

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. Select *On-Premises ONTAP*.

+
Your ONTAP clusters display with a status of whether they have been discovered in BlueXP.
+
If you are prompted to enter your NetApp Support Site (NSS) account credentials first, select *Add NSS Account*. After you add the account, the clusters associated with that NSS account appear.

. Select *Discover* for the cluster that you want to manage through BlueXP.

. On the _Discover ONTAP Cluster_ page, enter the password for the admin user account and select *Discover*.

+
Note that the cluster management IP address is populated based on information from your NetApp Support Site account.

.Result

BlueXP discovers the cluster and adds it as a working environment in the Canvas. The status for the cluster turns to *Discovered* in the _On-Premises ONTAP_ page. Note that the working environment name is the name of the cluster.
